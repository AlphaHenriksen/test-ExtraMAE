# Instructions for Reimplementation 

We provide the official implementation of Time Series Generation with Masked Autoencoder under the folder **MAI**. 

You may implement experiments on Stock, Sine, and Energy according to the ***README.md*** under **MAI**. 

We also provide three jupyter notes for you to preliminarily check the results.

- *ExtraMAE.ipynb* shows experiments on visualization, discrimination scores, prediction scores, and ablation study. 
- *Imputaition.ipynb* shows results for imputation
- *MaskRatio.ipynb* shows results in the study of mask ratios. 

 The jupyter notes rely on large experiment results. Therefore, the readers cannot run them directly. You may find the links for all results of experiments and runnable jupyter notes in *SupplementaryMaterial.pdf*.
